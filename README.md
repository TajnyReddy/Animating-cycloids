# Trochoid Animation
This Python script generates an animated visualization of various types of trochoids using Matplotlib library.

### Description
A trochoid is a curve described by a point attached to a circle that rolls along a straight line. This script allows you to visualize different types of trochoids:
* Cycloid
* Epicycloid
* Hypocycloid
* Custom Function-generated curve
  
The animation demonstrates how these curves are formed as the rolling circle moves along the line.
